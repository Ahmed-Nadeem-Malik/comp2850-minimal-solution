**Worst issue**: "My eyesight is not the best so would like the pop-up when confirming to delete to be bigger, also the cancel button on edit is a bit too small and would be harder press on a smaller size device like a phone"   
**Most helpful**: Really liked that the task list changed while typing in the filter box
**Accessibility**: Used keyboard only, could use all features
